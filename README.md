# Hi, I'm Marcel Lehmann 👋

Microsoft Business Applications MVP from Switzerland, specializing in **Power Apps**, **Power Automate** and **Copilot Studio** for small and midsize businesses (KMU) in the DACH region.

After more than 50+ projects, one thing is clear:  
automation should be **pragmatic, maintainable and business-driven** – not over‑engineered.
